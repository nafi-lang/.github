# Contributing

We're thrilled at your interest in Nafi!

Nafi is currently a single developer passion project by [@CAD97](https://github.com/CAD97/). We appreciate your interest, but for practical reasons it's unlikely we'll be able to accept large contributions at this time. Smaller contributions (e.g. localized fixes/improvements) are generally greatly appreciated!

The _best_ way to contribute to the project currently, however, is to try it out and report back on how that went; what went well, what went wrong, what could have been better, etc. We can't guarantee that we'll respond to all such experience reports, but we do read them all.

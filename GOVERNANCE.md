## Governance

[@nafi-lang]'s governance is fairly flat and managed via [team membership](https://github.com/orgs/nafi-lang/teams) on GitHub.

- [@CAD97] is the BDFL and has final say. They hope to delegate power/responsibility in the future if/when the project scales.
- [@nafi-lang/moderation] is responsible for enforcing the [@nafi-lang] code of conduct.
- [@nafi-lang/security] is responsible for handling potential security issues reported to [@nafi-lang] projects.
- [@nafi-lang/triage] has triage permissions to manage issues/PRs/discussions in [@nafi-lang] repositories.
- [@nafi-lang/review] has review permissions to merge contributions into [@nafi-lang] repositories.
- [@nafi-lang/ops] has admin access to manage CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions).

Teams can be `@mentioned` by organization members but notifications are disabled for these top-level teams[^security]. Subteams are used for notification and auto assignment groups as useful.

[^security]: Some exceptions apply for the security team, which does get notified for security reports.

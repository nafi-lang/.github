## Hi there 👋

Nafi is an experimental hobby scripting language prioritizing IDE support via [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and targeting the wasm plugin ecosystem first.

### Contribution guidelines

Nafi is currently a single developer passion project by [@CAD97](https://github.com/CAD97/). We appreciate your interest, but for practical reasons it's unlikely we'll be able to accept nontrivial contributions at this time. For more info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md].

### Fun fact

- "Nafi" was originally an initialism for "Nobody Asked For It".
